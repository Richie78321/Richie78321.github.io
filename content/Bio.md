_tldr;_ I am a computer science student currently studying at the University of Pittsburgh.

I learn by building things. Personal projects let me explore what's possible with computer science. I also share the joy of personal projects with my peers through my role as the Experiential Learning Director for [Pitt CSC](https://pittcsc.org/), Pitt's largest computer science organization on campus.

My professional career has brought me to [**Google**](https://www.google.com/), [**Two Sigma** (financial sciences)](https://www.twosigma.com/), [**Aurora** (self-driving)](https://aurora.tech/), [**Semiotic Labs** (blockchain)](https://www.semiotic.ai/), and [**Timberlane**](https://www.timberlane.com/).
